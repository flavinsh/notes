The **sample mean** $\overline{X}$ is the average value of a sample of numbers taken from a larger population of numbers:
$$\Large{\overline{X}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}}{n}}$$

where $n$ is the number of observations in the sample.

> [!remark] The sample mean itself  $\overline{X}$ is a random variable.
