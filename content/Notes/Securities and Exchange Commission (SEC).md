The **Security and Exchange Commission** (SEC) is an independent federal government regulatory agency responsible for:
1. protecting investors
2. maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets
3. facilitate capital formation

Also, the SEC:
- monitors corporate takeover actions in the United States
- approves registration statement for [[Book runner|book runners]]
- is a member of [[International Organisation of Securities Commission (IOSCO)]], and uses  IOSCO and bilateral agreements with other countries' securities commissions to deal with cross-border misconduct in securities markets.

## Background

Prior to the enactment of the federal securities laws and the creation of the SEC, securities trading was government by so-called blue sky laws. These laws were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. 

Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offering and sales, as well as every U.S. stockbroker and brokerage firm. However blue sky laws were generally considered ineffective. For example, they could be circumvented by making securities offerings across state lines through the mail.
## Founding

The SEC was established under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] by the:
- Securities Act of 1933
- Securities Exchange act of 1934

### Securities Act of 1933

After the Pecora Commission hearings on abuses and frauds in securities markets, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933, which federally regulates original issues of securities across states lines, primarily by requiring that issuing companies register distributions prior to sale so that investors may access basic financial information and make informed decisions.
### Securities Exchange Act of 1934

The subsequent Securities Act of 1934 regulates secondary markets for securities.
[[Federal Trade Commission (FTC)|FTC]]'s enforcement authority of both acts was transferred to the newly created SEC.

At the time, SEC's missions were to:
1. restore investor confidence in the securities market, which has practically collapsed
2. restore integrity to securities markets by prosecuting and eliminating fraudulent and unsound practices targeting investors
3. end million-dollar insider trading by top officials of major corporations
4. establish a complex and universal system of registration for securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines.

## Requirements for public companies

To achieve its mandate, the SEC enforces the statutory requirement that public companies submit quarterly and annual reports, including [[Management discussion and analysis (MD&A)|MD&A]] and mandatory disclosures. They give private individuals and large institutions the same basic facts about the public companies they invest in, thereby increasing public scrutiny while reducing insider trading and fraud.

## EDGAR database

Since 1994, the SEC has made reports available through the [[Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR)]] system.



## Divisions

The SEC's divisions are:
1. Corporation Finance
2. Trading and Markets
3. Investment Management
4. Enforcement
5. Economic and Risk Analysis
6. Examinations

### Corporation Finance

**Corporation Finance** is the division that:

- oversees the disclosure made by public companies
- oversees the registration of transactions, such as mergers
- is responsible for operating the EDGAR online database

### Trading and Markets

**Trading and Markets** is the division that:
- oversees self-regulatory organisations (SROs), such as:
	- [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]]
	- [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)]]
	- broker-dealer firms
	- investment houses
- interprets proposed changes to regulations
- monitors operations of the industry

In practice, the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)|FINRA]]. In fact, all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA. Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become registered representatives.

### Investment Management

**Investment Management** is the division that oversees registered investment companies (mutual funds, registered investment advisors).

### Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

The Division of **Economic and Risk Analysis** (DERA) is SEC's think tank, created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. 

The division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including:
- policy-making
- rule-making
- enforcement
- examination

It also assists in the SEC's efforts to identify, analyse, and response to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. 

Through the range and nature of its activities, DERA serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency's institutional expertise.

DERA's activities include:
- providing detailed, high quality economic and statistical analyses
- developing customised analytic tools to proactively detect market risks indicative of possible violations of the Federal securities laws

### Examinations

The division of **Examinations** conducts the SEC's National Exam Program
