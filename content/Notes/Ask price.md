The **ask** is the lowest price that sellers are willing to sell a security for.

> [!remark] 
> The asking price is like a price tag: you read the amount of money the seller is asking to sell.

> [!example]-
> Microsoft Corp (MSFT): 374.80 â€“ 374.82
> 
> **Ask price: 374.82**
> - This is the price the market is asking for (willing to sell) one share of Microsoft
> - You can buy one share of Microsoft (from the market) at this price
