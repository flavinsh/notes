**Cost of goods sold** (COGS) is the [[expense]] that is automatically triggered when [[Revenue recognition|revenue is recognised]], due to the [[matching principle]].  It is also know as cost of sales.

COGS amounts depends on the accounting choice of [[inventory valuation method]]:
- [[First in first out (FIFO)]]
- [[Last in first out (LIFO)]]
- [[Weighted average (WA)]]

>[!memo]- "Out" = sold = COGS
> - FIFO = Old inventory is out (sold) first = $\text{COGS}_{FIFO}$ is based on old inventory
> - LIFO = New production is out (sold) first = $\text{COGS}_{LIFO}$ is based on new inventory
