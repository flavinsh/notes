**Beta** $(\beta)$ is a measure of volatility —or [[Systematic risk]]— of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole (the S&P 500 may be used as a proxy). Stocks (or portfolios) with betas higher than 1 can be interpreted as more volatile than the market.
$$\Large{\beta_{a}=\frac{Cov(a,m)}{\sigma_{m}^2}}$$
Substituting the [[Covariance]], we obtain:
$$\Large{\beta_{a}=\rho_{a,m}\times{\frac{\sigma_{a}}{\sigma_{m}}}}$$

> $$\begin{align*}
> \beta_{a}
> &=\dfrac{\color{red}{}Cov(r_{a},r_{m})}{\sigma_{m}^{2}}\\\\
> &=\dfrac{\color{red}\rho_{a,m}\cdot{\sigma_{a}\cdot\sigma_{m}}}{\sigma_{m}^{2}}\\\\
> &=\rho_{a,m}\times\dfrac{\sigma_{a}}{\sigma_{m}}
> \end{align*}$$
