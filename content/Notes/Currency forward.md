A **currency forward** is a type of [[Forward contract]] where the underlying is the quote of a currency pair. It is a binding contract in the [[Foreign exchange market]] that locks in the [[Exchange rate]] for the purchase or sale of a currency on a future date.

A currency forward:
- is an [[Over-the-counter (OTC)|OTC]] instrument and does not trade on a centralised exchange
- does not involve an upfront payment, unlike futures (margin) and options (premium)
- can be settled on a cash basis or delivery basis
- is essentially a customisable hedging tool against fluctuations in exchange rates

> [!tldr] TL;DR
> Currency forward = OTC instrument that locks-in future exchange rate
