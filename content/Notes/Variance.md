The **variance** is a [[Measures of dispersion|measure of dispersion]] of a random variable. It measures how far each value is from the mean.

$$\Large{V(X)=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}{(x_{i}-\text{E}[X])^2}}{N}}$$ 
where:
- $\text{E}[X]$ is the [[expected value]] of the random variable $X$

## Sample variance

## Variance and covariance

## Variance and standard deviation

> [!remark]-
> In other words:
$$\Large{\text{V}(X)=\sigma^2_{X}}$$
