## Bond expected return
$E(R) = Yield$ only when:
1. The bond is held until maturity
2. Coupons and principal are received on time
3. All coupons are reinvested at the original YTM (*least* realistic assumption)

## Forward pricing model

### Forward pricing model
> [!definition]
> **Forward pricing model** 
> Values forward contracts using *arbitrage-free* pricing. 
> Investors should be indifferent between:
> - Buying today a zero-coupon bond maturing in $j+k$ years ($P_{j+k}$)
> - Entering today a contract to buy a zero-coupon bond in $j$ years, maturing $k$ years later
>   
>  The two investments should have the same price: 
>   $$\boxed{P_{j+k}=P_jF_{(j,k)}}$$
>
> Therefore:
>   $$\boxed{F_{(j,k)} = P_{j+k}/P_j}$$

## Spot and forward relationships
An active PM will try to outperform the market by predicting how the future spot rates will differ from those predicted by the *current* forward curve.

If the future spot rates are:
- Exactly as the current forward rates, then $HPR_{bond}=r_{f}$
- Below the current forward rates, then $HPR_{bond}>r_{f}$
- Above the current forward rates, then $HPR_{bond}<r_{f}$

**Remark**: 
- $â†“Rates \implies \: â†‘Value$
- $â†‘Rates \implies \: â†“Value$

## Rolling down the yield curve
If the yield curve is *upward*-sloping:
- Investors will purchase bonds with $Maturity > HRP$
- As time passes ($â†“Maturity$), the bond's cash flows will be discounted at successively lower yield ($â†“Discount \:rate$), hence the bond's price will increase ($â†‘PV$).
- This strategy will produce superior returns *if the yield curve remains stable* over the investment horizon.

ðŸ‘Ž Cons
- Increases interest rate risk ($â†‘Maturity= \: â†‘Duration$)

## Z-Spread
When added to each spot rate, makes the PV of a bond's cash flows equal to the bond market price.

$$ \boxed{P=\sum{\frac{CF}{(1+S_{i}+Z)^i}}}$$
- Constant spread added to the *default-free* spot curve
- Spread over the entire spot rate curve
- Z-Spread = "*Zero-volatility* spread" (assumption of zero interest rate volatility)
- Z-Spread is **not** appropriate to value bonds with embedded options


> [!Example]- Z-Spread

## Shape of the yield curve
Why does the yield curve take a particular shape ?

**Traditional theories**
1. Unbiased / Pure expectations theory
2. Local expectations theory
3. Liquidity preference theory
4. Segmented markets theory
5. Preferred habitat theory

### Unbiased / Pure expectations theory
Investor's expectations determine the shape of the yield curve:
- Forward rates are solely a function of expected future spot
- LT interest rates are a  mean of future *expected* ST rates
- **Risk-neutrality**: Investors don't demand a risk premium for maturity strategies that differ from their investment horizon.
- Every maturity strategy has the same expected return

If the yield curve is:
- Upward sloping: ST rates are expected to rise
- Downward sloping: ST rates are expected to fall
- Flat: ST rates are expected to remain constant

### Local expectations theory
Similar to [[Unbiased expectations theory]] except:
- Risk-neutrality assumption only preserved over **short** holding periods.
- Over longer periods, risk premiums should exist.
- Over short time periods, every bond should earn the risk-free rate

Remark:
- Does not hold in real life as over short holding periods $R_{LT \: Bond}>R_{ST \: Bond}$ 
- This is explained by liquidity premiums and hedging concerns

### Liquidity preference theory
Forward rates reflect investors' expectations of future spot rates, plus a **liquidity premium** to compensate investors for exposure to interest rate risk.
- Liquidity preference theory = Unbiased expectations theory **+ Liquidity premium**
- Liquidity premium positively related to maturity ($â†‘Maturity \implies â†‘Premium$)
- Forward rates are **biased** estimates of the market's expectation of future spot rates (because they include a liquidity premium)

An upward-sloping yield curve may indicate that either:
	- The market expects future interest rates to rise
	- Rates are expected to remain constant / fall, but the addition of a liquidity premium results in a positive slope
	  
A downward-sloping yield curve indicates steeply falling short-term rates.


> [! Definition] Segmented markets theory
The shape of the [[Yield curve|yield curve]] is determined by the borrowers and lenders
- Borrowers and lenders drive the balance of supply and demand for loans of different maturity
- The yield at each maturity is determined independently (*segmented*)
- Yield curve **not** determined by expected spot rates and liquidity premium

Remark:
- Pension plans and insurance companies:
	- Primarily purchase long-maturity bonds for [[Asset-liability matching|asset-liability matching]] reasons
	- Are unlikely to participate in the market for short-term funds> [! Definition]


> [!definition] Preferred habitat theory
Similar to [[Liquidity preference theory]], but liquidity premium is **not** directly related to maturity
- The imbalance between supply and demand for funds in a given maturity range (*habitat*) will induce lenders and borrowers to **shift** from their preferred habitat to one that has the **opposite imbalance**.
- To entice investors to do so, investors must be offered an **incentive** to compensate for the exposure to price / reinvestment risk in the less-than-preferred habitat:
	- Borrowers require cost savings ($â†“Yield$)
	- Lenders require a yield premium ($â†‘Yield$)

## Yield curve shifts
### Parallel shifts
- Parallel shift = Level change
- Interest rates go up/down by the same amount across all maturities
  
  ![[Yield curve - Parallel shift.png#invert|150]]

### Nonparallel shift 
- Steepness changes
- Curvature change

## Measuring yield curve sensitivity
Measures of interest rate risk:
1. [[Effective duration]]
2. [[Key rate duration]]
3. Sensitivity to parallel, steepness, curvature movements

### Effective duration
Measures bond price risk for small ***parallel*** shifts in the [[Yield curve|yield curve]]

Problem: 
- Most yield curve shifts have nonparallel characteristics.
- Use [[Key rate duration|key rate duration]] to measure the impact of nonparallel shifts.

### Key rate duration
Quantifies bond price sensitivity to ***nonparallel*** shifts in the [[Yield curve|yield curve]]
- Key rate duration = price sensitivity to 1% change in a single **par** rate (holding other par rates constant)

### Sensitivity to parallel, steepness, curvature movements
We can decompose bond price sensitivity to several kind of movements in the yield curve:
- **Level** ($\Delta X_{L}$): parallel shift
- **Steepness** ($\Delta X_{S}$): $â†‘r_{LT}$ and $â†“r_{ST}$
- **Curvature** ($\Delta X_{C}$): $â†‘r_{LT}$, $â†‘r_{ST}$, but $r_{inter}$ don't change

We can then model the change in value of a portfolio:
$\boxed{\Delta P/P\approx-D_{L}\Delta X_{L}-D_{S}\Delta X_{S}-D_{X}\Delta X_{C}}$

where:
- $D_{L}$: sensitivity to changes in Level
- $D_{S}$: sensitivity to changes in Steepness
- $D_{C}$: sensitivity to changes in Curvature
