The **bachelor's master's doctorate system** is a reform designed by the [[Bologna Process]] to standardise the educational system at European universities, including:
- content
- curriculum
- syllabus
- course credits

As a result of this reform, European universities will offer the following three degree levels (but the names will vary from country to country):
- [[Bachelor's degree]]
- [[Master's degree]]
- [[Doctoral degree]]
