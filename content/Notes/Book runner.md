A **book runner** is the primary underwriter or lead coordinator that runs or is in charge of the books, for example during an IPO.

Investment banks are one type of company that employs underwriters. The entire underwriting department of an investment bank can serve as book runner.

The book runner usually works with other investment banks to establish an underwriting syndicate, thereby creating the initial sales force for shares. This reduces risk but also decreases the share of profit that each part of the syndicate makes. However, because the book runner takes on the most responsibility during the offering, they also usually get the highest commission from the transaction (up to 6â€“8%).

## Responsibilities of book runners

Determining the final offering price is one of the biggest responsibilities of an underwriter. The book runner both determines:
- the size of the proceeds to the issuer (highest possible price)
- how easily the underwriter can sell the securities to buyers (lowest possible price)

The issuer and book runner usually work together to determine the price. 

Once they agree on a price for the securities and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|SEC]] makes the registration statement effective, the underwriters call the subscribers to confirm their orders.

> Being the lead underwriter for a stock offering, especially an IPO, can bring a large payday if the market shows a high demand for the shares:
> -  the underwriters and the issuer may raise the price and reconfirm the sale with subscribers.
