**Android OS** is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux [[Kernel]] and other open-source software, designed primarily for touch screen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 

Android OS was unveiled in November 2007, and released to the public in September 2008 with the launch of the [[HTC Dream]], the first commercial Android device.

Although the [[Android open source project (AOSP)|core version,]] of Android is [[Free and open source software (FOSS)|free and open source]], Google's proprietary version of Android is used by over 70 percent of AOSP-based smartphones. It comes with additional software pre-installed, most notably [[Google Mobile Services (GMS)]].

> [!tldr] TL;DR
> Android = Google's fork of AOSP = 70% market share
