The **Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board** (MSRB) was established in 1975 by Congress to develop rules for companies involved in underwriting and trading municipal securities. 

The MSRB is monitored by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|SEC]] and does not have the authority to enforce its rules.
