An **arbitrage** opportunity is a deal that involves no cash outlay but generates risk-free profits. It involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of mispriced assets with identical cash flows in different markets. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies, and it both exploits and resolves them.

There are two broad categories of arbitrage opportunities:
1. [[Dominance]]
2. [[Value additivity]]

> Arbitrage = riskless profit
## Risk

Although an arbitrage is risk-free in theory, losses may occur in practice:
- [[Execution risk]]
- [[Counterparty risk]]
- [[Liquidity risk]]
