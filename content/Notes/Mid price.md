The **mid price** is the exact mid-point between the quoted [[Bid price]] and [[Ask price]] for a security.

> [!remark] 
> While you cannot trade at the mid price, many investors treat it as a proxy for the actual price of a security.

> [!example]-
> Microsoft Corp (MSFT): 374.80 â€“ 374.82
> 
> **Mid price: 375.81**
> 
> - This is a proxy for the actual price of a share of Microsoft
