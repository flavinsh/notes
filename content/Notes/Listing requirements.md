**Listing requirements** comprise the various criteria and minimum standards established by [[Stock exchanges]] that companies must meet to list their shares for trading. 

Listing requirements vary by exchange and include:
- minimum stockholder's equity
- minimum share price
- minimum number of shareholders
- underlying financial viability of the issuing firm
- initial and ongoing yearly listing fees

Exchanges establish these standards as a means of maintaining their own integrity, reputation, and visibility.

Companies that do not meet listing requirements on major exchanges may be able to offer their shares for trading [[Over-the-counter (OTC)|over-the-counter]]. However, OTC trading does not provide anywhere near the liquidity, regulatory oversight prestige or visibility as trading on one major stock exchange provides.

## Listing requirements in practice

### Size and liquidity

Listing requirements vary by exchange but there are certain metrics which are almost always included: 
- Size of the firm (annual income or market capitalisation)
- Liquidity of the shares (a certain number of shares must already have been issued)

> [!example] Example: NYSE
> The NYSE requires firms to already have 1.1 million publicly-traded shares outstanding with a collective market value of at least \$40 million ($100 million for worldwide trading), as well as a minimum security listing price of \$4 per share.

> [!example] Example: Nasdaq
> The Nasdaq requires firms to already have 1.25 million publicly-traded shares with a collective market of \$45 million, as well as a minimum security listing price of \$4 per share.

### Fees
Usually, an initial listing fee as well as yearly listing fees are required.

> [!note]
> Nasdaq fees (\$75,000 per year) are considerably lower than those of the NYSE (\$295,000 per year). This lower cost has made the Nasdaq a more popular choice of exchange for newer or smaller firms.


## Delisting

Company can be delisted if:
- they fail to pay annual fees
- they can no longer meet the financial/liquidity requirements of an exchange
- their share price drops below a certain minimum (\$4 per share for NYSE, Nasdaq) 

Once delisted from a particular exchange, investors won't be able to trade a company's stock on that exchange.
