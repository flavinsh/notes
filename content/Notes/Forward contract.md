A **forward contract** is a customised contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price ([[Forward price]]) on a future date ([[settlement]] date), and can be settled on a cash or delivery basis. 
## Usage

Forward contracts can be used for [[hedging]] or [[speculation]].
## Difference with futures

Unlike standard [[Futures contracts]], forward contracts do not trade on a centralised exchange and are therefore considered [[Over-the-counter (OTC)|OTC]] instruments:

> [!pros] 
> - Easier to customise terms
> - No initial investment required (no margin payment)
 
> [!cons] 
> - Higher degree of default risk (lack of a centralised clearinghouse)
> - Not marked-to-market, only settled on the settlement date
## Size

The market for forward contracts is huge since many of the world's biggest corporations use it to hedge currency and interest rate risks. 

However, since the details of forward contracts are restricted to the buyer and seller —and are not known to the general public—the size of this market is difficult to estimate.

## Tail risk

The large size and unregulated nature of the forward contract market mean that it may be susceptible to a cascading series of defaults in the worst-case scenario. While banks and financial corporations mitigate this risk by being very careful in their choice of counterparty, the possibility of large-scale default does exist.
