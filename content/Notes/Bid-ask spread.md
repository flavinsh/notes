The **bid-ask spread** is the difference between the [[Bid price]] and [[Ask price]]. In other words, it is the amount by which the ask price exceeds the bid price for an asset in the market.
$$\Large{\text{Bid-ask spread}=\text{Ask price}-\text{Bid price}}$$

and:

$$\Large{\text{Bid-ask spread} (\%)=\frac{\text{Bid-ask spread}}{\text{Mid point}}}$$

The spread is the transaction cost:
- Price takers buy at the ask price (high) and sell at the bid price (low)
- Market makers buy at the bid price (low) and sells at the ask price (high)
