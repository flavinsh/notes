**Value additivity** is a type of [[Arbitrage opportunity|arbitrage opportunity]] where the value of an asset differs from the sum of its parts (that is when the [[Value additivity principle]] does not hold). 

In these conditions, arbitrage profits can be earned by:
1. [[Stripping]]: buy asset low, sell strips higher
2. [[Reconstitution]]: buy strips low, sell asset higher
