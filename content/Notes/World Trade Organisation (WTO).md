The **World Trade Organisation** (WTO) is an intergovernmental [[International Organisations|organisation]] that regulates and facilitates international trade. With effective cooperation in the United Nations System, governments use the organisation to establish, revise, and enforce the rules that govern international trade.


In 1947, the [[General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)|GATT]] implemented a free-trade agreement between 23 countries, with the goals to:
1.  lower consumer prices
2. lower tariffs
3. boost international trade 
 
In 1995, it became the [[World Trade Organisation (WTO)|WTO]], an international organisation of 164 countries focusing on trade regulation and aiming to:
1. reduce barriers to free-trade
2. help governments manage business tensions
3. assist importers, exporters, producers

In 2001, [[China]] – the world's largest communist country – joined the WTO.
