$$\Large{\sigma_{XY}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i}-\mu_{X})(y_{i}-\mu_{Y})}{N}}$$ ^d64205

where:
- $\mu_{X}$ and $\mu_{Y}$ are the [[Population mean|population means]] of the random variables $X$ and $Y$
- $N$ is the number of observations of $X$ and $Y$

#WIP Same number of observation for X and Y ?
