The **bid** is the highest price that buyers are willing to pay for a for a security.

In a perfect world, we would be able to buy the stock at the bid price, but it is rarely possible. Buyers' options are:
1. Pay the [[Ask price]] of the seller
2. Make a new, higher bid price (and see if the seller is willing to meet you at that price)

The latter is the most frequent result of a trade, where the buyer and the seller meet in the middle at [[Mid price]].

> Microsoft Corp (MSFT): 374.80 â€“ 374.82
> 
> **Bid price: 374.80**
> - This is the price the market is bidding for (willing to buy) one share
> - You can sell one share (to the market) at this price
