**Dominance** is a type of [[Arbitrage opportunity]] where one security consistently offers a better yield than another security with identical characteristics.

> [!example]-
>  Consider two risk-free zero-coupon bonds that mature one year from today:
>
> | Bonds | Coupon | Maturity | Nominal | Price |
> |:-----:|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|
> |   A   |   0%   |  1 year  |   105   |  100  |
> |   B   |   0%   |  1 year  |   330   |  300  |
> 
> An arbitrage opportunity exists:
> - Sell short three units of A (+$300) and purchase one unit of B (-$300)
> - At maturity, A will produce a cash outflow (-$315) and B a cash inflow (+330)
> - Pocket the difference ($15)
