**Reconstitution** is a type of [[Arbitrage opportunity]] opportunity that occurs when the [[Value additivity principle]] does not hold. If the value of the whole is higher than the sum of the parts:
1. Buy the part (lower)
2. Reconstitute the whole
3. Sell the whole (higher)
4. Pocket the difference

> [!Example]- 
> A three-year bond with a 10% annual coupon and $1,000 face value is priced at $1,100, and the Treasury spot rates are given by:
>  
> | Year | Spot rates |
> | :----: | :----------: |
> | 1    | 7%         |
> | 2    | 8%         |
> | 3    | 7%         |
> 
  > The value of this bond (sum of the parts) is:
  > $$V=\frac{100}{1.07}+\frac{100}{1.08^2}+\frac{1,100}{1.07^{3}}=1,077.12<1,100$$
  > 
  > An arbitrage opportunity exists:
  > 1. Buy a portfolio of three zero coupons for $1,077.12
  > 	- $100 in one year
  > 	- $100 in two years
  > 	- $1100 in three years
  > 1. Combine them to recreate the bond
  > 1. Sell the bond at the current market price of $1,110
  > 1. Pocket the difference of $22.88
