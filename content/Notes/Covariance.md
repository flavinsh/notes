**Covariance** is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables:

$$\Large{\text{Cov}(X,Y)=\text{E}\bigg[(X-\text{E}[X])(Y-\text{E}[Y])\bigg]}$$

## Population covariance

![[Population covariance#^d64205]]

## Sample covariance

![[Sample covariance#^f7da96]]

## Covariance and variance

The covariance between of a random variable $X$ and itself is the [[variance]] of $X$: 
  
$$\Large{\text{Cov}(X,X)=\text{V}(X)}$$ ^de5e33

This is why the diagonal of a [[variance-covariance matrix]] are the variances of each variable.
