Statistical inference makes propositions about a [[Population]], using data from a sample.

Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we want to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of:
1. Selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data
2. Deducing propositions from the model.

## Inferential statistics
- Infer properties of a populatio
- Assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population
## Descriptive statistics
- Solely concerned with properties of the observed data
- Do no rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population
