**Inventory valuation method** is a way of determining the value that is affected to:
- [[Inventory]] (unsold goods)  
- [[Cost of goods sold (COGS)]] (sold goods)

To value inventories and COGS, companies may choose between:
- [[First in first out (FIFO)]]
- [[Last in first out (LIFO)]]
- [[Weighted average (WA)]]
   
## Impact on financial statements

Since the choice of inventory valuation method determines inventory and COGS, it impacts the:
- [[Balance sheet ]]
- [[Income statement]]
- [[Financial ratios]]

> [!warning] Inventory method = may be used to manage earnings

### If overall prices increase over time

#### LIFO
| Description | Impact | Explanation |
| ---- | :--: | ---- |
| $\text{Inventory}_{LIFO}$ | ↓ | Remaining inventory is old, cheaper |
| $\text{COGS}_{LIFO}$ | ↑ | New sales are based on last, more expensive inventory |
| $\text{Profits}_{LIFO}$ | ↓ | Higher COGS, lower profits |
| $\text{Taxes}_{LIFO}$ | ↓ | Lower profits, lower taxes |
#### FIFO
| Description               | Impact | Explanation |
| ------------------------- |:------:| ----------- |
| $\text{Inventory}_{FIFO}$ |   ↑    | Remaining inventory is recent, more expensive            |
| $\text{COGS}_{FIFO}$      |   ↓    | New sales are based on old, cheaper inventory            |
| $\text{Profits}_{FIFO}$   |   ↑    | Lower COGS, higher profits            |
| $\text{Taxes}_{FIFO}$     |   ↑    | Higher profits, higher taxes            |
#### Weighted average

Weighted average inventory methods leads to value between LIFO and FIFO.

> [!remark] 
> In practice, this is the most likely scenario, as [[inflation]] is positive most of the time.

### If overall prices decrease over time

If deflation occurs, the impact on financial statements will be opposite.
