The **standard deviation** is a [[Measures of dispersion|measure of dispersion]] of a random variable. It measures how far away each value is from the mean, on average. The [[standard deviation]] is the square root of the variance:

$$\Large{\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{V(X)}}$$ ^1de41a
## Population standard deviation

![[Population standard deviation#^a16dd1]]

## Sample standard deviation

![[Sample standard deviation#^d69b37]]
