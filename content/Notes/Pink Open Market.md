The **Pink Open Market** is an [[Over-the-counter (OTC)|over-the-counter]] trading network organised by broker-dealers. It is the riskiest level of OTC trading with no requirements to report financials or register with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|SEC]].

Some legitimate companies exist on the Pink Open Market, however, there are many shell companies and companies with no actual business operations listed here.
