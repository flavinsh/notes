**Revenue recognition** is a set of rules that determine under which conditions a transaction is considered a sale from an accounting perspective, and therefore triggers revenue in the income statement.

Revenue is recognised when there is:
- delivery
- transfer of property
- contractual obligation satisfied

> [!warning] Regardless of cash payment

In this case, the transaction will be reported as revenue in the income statement.

## Timing difference
In case case goods or services are paid upfront, prior delivery, the transaction will be _not_ count as revenue in the income statement. 
Besides, a liability is created in the balance sheet (unearned revenue) to indicate that the company has yet to deliver.
